Thank you for considering a contribution to Subiquity.  Here's what we like to
see:

* Contributors will need to have signed the
  [CLA](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors/agreement).
* Prerequisites for running tests locally can be installed with `make aptdeps`.
* Lint, unit, integration, and API tests should be passing.  To simulate that
  locally please run `make lint check`.  This is a close approximation to what
  is run in CI today.
