Autoinstall configuration reference manual
==========================================

The autoinstall file uses the YAML format. At the top level is a single key, ``autoinstall``, which contains a mapping of the keys described in this document. Unrecognized keys are ignored in version 1, but they will cause a fatal validation error in future versions.

Here is an example of a minimal autoinstall configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      version: 1
      identity:
       ...


At the top level is the ``autoinstall`` keyword. It contains a ``version`` section and an (incomplete) ``identity`` section, which are explained in more detail below. Any other key at the level of ``autoinstall`` results in an autoinstall validation error at run time.

.. note::

    This behavior was first introduced during 24.04 (Noble). On any ISOs built before 24.04, you need to refresh the installer to see this behavior.

    Technically, in all but one case the top level ``autoinstall`` keyword is strictly unnecessary. This keyword is only necessary when serving autoinstall via cloud-config. For backwards compatibility, this format is still supported for delivery methods not based on cloud-config; however, it is **highly recommended** to use the format with a top-level ``autoinstall`` keyword because mistakes in this formatting are a common source of confusion.


.. _ai-schema:

Schema
------

Autoinstall configurations are :doc:`validated against a JSON schema <autoinstall-schema>` before they are
used.

.. _ai-command-lists:

Command lists
-------------

Several configuration keys are lists of commands to be executed. Each command can be a string (in which case it is executed via :command:`sh -c`) or a list, in which case it is executed directly. Any command exiting with a non-zero return code is considered an error and aborts the installation (except for error-commands, where it is ignored).

.. _ai-top-level-keys:

Top-level keys
--------------

The following keys can be used to configure various aspects of the installation. If the global ``autoinstall`` key is provided, then all "top-level keys" must be provided underneath it and "top-level" refers to this sub-level. The examples below demonstrate this structure.

.. warning::

  In version 1, Subiquity emits warnings when encountering unrecognized keys. In later versions, it results in a fatal validation error, and the installation halts.

.. _ai-version:

version
~~~~~~~

* **type:** integer
* **default:** no default

A future-proofing configuration file version field. Currently, this must be ``1``.

.. _ai-interactive-sections:

interactive-sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** list of strings
* **default:** []

A list of configuration keys to still show in the user interface (UI). For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      version: 1
      interactive-sections:
        - network
      identity:
        username: ubuntu
        password: $crypted_pass

This example stops on the network screen and allows the user to change the defaults. If a value is provided for an interactive section, it is used as the default.

You can use the special section name of ``*`` to indicate that the installer should ask all the usual questions -- in this case, the :file:`autoinstall.yaml` file is an autoinstall file. It just provides a way to change the defaults in the UI.

Not all configuration keys correspond to screens in the UI. This documentation indicates if a given section can be interactive or not.

If there are any interactive sections at all, the :ref:`ai-reporting` key is ignored.

.. _ai-early-commands:

early-commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** :ref:`command list<ai-command-lists>`
* **default:** no commands
* **can be interactive:** no

A list of shell commands to invoke as soon as the installer starts, in particular before probing for block and network devices. The autoinstall configuration is available at :file:`/autoinstall.yaml` (irrespective of how it was provided), and the file is re-read after the ``early-commands`` have run to allow them to alter the configuration if necessary.

Example early commands:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # Pause the install just before starting to allow manual inspection/modification of the live system.
     # Unpause by creating the "/run/finish-early" file.
     early-commands:
       - while [ ! -f /run/finish-early ]; do sleep 1; done

   autoinstall:
     # Replace the current autoinstall configuration with one provided by a trusted server
     early-commands:
       - wget -O /autoinstall.yaml $TRUSTED_SERVER_URL


.. _ai-locale:

locale
~~~~~~

* **type:** string
* **default:** ``en_US.UTF-8``
* **can be interactive:** true

The locale to configure for the installed system.

locale examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # default behavior
     locale: "en_US.UTF-8"

   autoinstall:
     # Greek locale
     locale: "el_GR"

.. _ai-refresh-installer:

refresh-installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping
* **default:** see below
* **can be interactive:** true

Controls whether the installer updates to a new version available in the given channel before continuing.

The mapping contains keys:

update
^^^^^^

* **type:** boolean
* **default:** ``false``

Whether to update or not.

channel
^^^^^^^

* **type:** string
* **default:** ``"stable/ubuntu-$REL"``

The channel to check for updates.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  autoinstall:
   # Refresh to the latest snap built from the "main" subiquity branch
   refresh-installer:
     update: true
     channel: latest/edge

  autoinstall:
   # Refresh to the latest beta release
   refresh-installer:
     update: true
     channel: latest/beta


.. _ai-keyboard:

keyboard
~~~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** US English keyboard
* **can be interactive:** true

The layout of any attached keyboard. The mapping keys correspond to settings in the :file:`/etc/default/keyboard` configuration file. See the :manpage:`keyboard(5)` manual page for more details.

The mapping contains keys:

layout
^^^^^^

* **type:** string
* **default:** ``"us"``

Corresponds to the ``XKBLAYOUT`` setting.

variant
^^^^^^^

* **type:** string
* **default:** ``""``

Corresponds to the ``XKBVARIANT`` setting.

toggle
^^^^^^

* **type:** string or null
* **default:** ``null``

Corresponds to the value of ``grp:`` option from the ``XKBOPTIONS`` setting. Acceptable values are (the installer does not validate these):

* ``caps_toggle``
* ``toggle``
* ``rctrl_toggle``
* ``rshift_toggle``
* ``rwin_toggle``
* ``menu_toggle``
* ``alt_shift_toggle``
* ``ctrl_shift_toggle``
* ``ctrl_alt_toggle``
* ``alt_caps_toggle``
* ``lctrl_lshift_toggle``
* ``lalt_toggle``
* ``lctrl_toggle``
* ``lshift_toggle``
* ``lwin_toggle``
* ``sclk_toggle``

.. warning:: The version of Subiquity released with 20.04 GA does not accept ``null`` for this field due to a bug.

keyboard examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # default behavior
     keyboard:
       layout: us
       variant: ""
       toggle: null

   autoinstall:
     # use Alt and Shift to toggle between default US keyboard and
     # "Greek (simple)"
     keyboard:
       layout: "us,gr"
       variant: ",simple"
       toggle: alt_shift_toggle

.. _ai-source:

source
~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** see below
* **can be interactive:** true

search_drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **type:** boolean
* **default:** ``true`` (mostly, see below)

Whether the installer searches for available third-party drivers. When set to ``false``, it disables the drivers :ref:`screen and section<ai-drivers>`.

The default is ``true`` for most installations, and ``false`` when a "core boot" or "enhanced secure boot" method is selected (where third-party drivers cannot be currently installed).

id
^^

* **type:** string
* **default:** the default value as listed in install-sources

Identifier of the source to install (e.g., ``ubuntu-server-minimal``).  The correct ID to use is specific to a given installation ISO. As this ID may change over time, the canonical place to look for this information is the installation ISO itself, in the ``casper/install-sources.yaml`` file where the value to use is the ``id``.

Current values:

* Ubuntu Server:

  * minimal: ``ubuntu-server-minimal``
  * standard (default): ``ubuntu-server``

* Ubuntu Desktop:

  * minimal (default): ``ubuntu-desktop-minimal``
  * standard: ``ubuntu-desktop``

* Ubuntu Budgie:

  * minimal: ``ubuntu-budgie-desktop-minimal``
  * standard (default): ``ubuntu-budgie-desktop``

* Ubuntu Cinnamon:

  * minimal: ``ubuntucinnamon-desktop-minimal``
  * standard (default): ``ubuntucinnamon-desktop``

* Edubuntu:

  * minimal: ``edubuntu-desktop-minimal``
  * standard (default): ``edubuntu-desktop``

* Ubuntu Kylin:

  * minimal: ``ubuntukylin-desktop-minimal``
  * standard (default): ``ubuntukylin-desktop``

* Ubuntu MATE:

  * minimal: ``ubuntu-mate-desktop-minimal``
  * standard (default): ``ubuntu-mate-desktop``

* Ubuntu Studio:

  * standard (default): ``ubuntustudio-desktop``

* Xubuntu:

  * full ISO:

    * minimal: ``xubuntu-desktop-minimal``
    * standard (default): ``xubuntu-desktop``

  * minimal ISO:

    * minimal (default): ``xubuntu-desktop-minimal``

source examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # default behavior
     source:
       search_drivers: true
       id: <the installation source marked as default in install-sources.yaml>

   autoinstall:
     # on the Ubuntu Server ISO, install with the minimal source
     source:
       id: ubuntu-server-minimal

   autoinstall:
     # on the Ubuntu Desktop ISO, install with the standard source
     source:
       id: ubuntu-desktop

.. _ai-network:

network
~~~~~~~

* **type:** Netplan-format mapping, see below
* **default:** DHCP on interfaces named ``eth*`` or ``en*``
* **can be interactive:** true

`Netplan-formatted <https://netplan.io/reference>`_ network configuration. This is applied during installation as well as in the installed system. The default is to interpret the configuration for the installation media, which runs DHCP version 4 on any interface with a name matching ``eth*`` or ``en*`` but then disables any interface that does not receive an address.

For example, to run DHCP version 6 on a specific network interface:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      network:
        version: 2
        ethernets:
          enp0s31f6:
            dhcp6: true

Note that in the 20.04 GA release of Subiquity, the behavior is slightly different and requires you to write this with an extra ``network:`` key:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      network:
        network:
          version: 2
          ethernets:
            enp0s31f6:
              dhcp6: true

Versions later than 20.04 support this syntax, too (for compatibility). When using a newer version, use the regular syntax.

.. _ai-proxy:

proxy
~~~~~

* **type:** URL or ``null``
* **default:** no proxy
* **can be interactive:** true

The proxy to configure both during installation and for ``apt`` and ``snapd`` in the target system. This setting is currently not honored when running the geoip lookup.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      proxy: http://172.16.90.1:3128

.. _ai-apt:

apt
~~~

* **type:** mapping
* **default:** see below
* **can be interactive:** true

APT configuration, used both during the installation and once booted into the target system.

This section has historically used the same format as curtin, which is documented in the `APT Source <https://curtin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/apt_source.html>`_ section of the curtin documentation. Nonetheless, some key differences with the format supported by curtin have been introduced:

- Subiquity supports an alternative format for the ``primary`` section, allowing configuration of a list of candidate primary mirrors. During installation, Subiquity automatically tests the specified mirrors and selects the first one that appears usable. This new behavior is only activated when the ``primary`` section is wrapped in the ``mirror-selection`` section.

- The ``fallback`` key controls what Subiquity does when no primary mirror is usable.

- The ``geoip`` key controls whether to perform IP-based geolocation to determine the correct country mirror.


All other sections behave as defined in curtin. See the curtin `documentation <https://curtin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/apt_source.html#common-snippets>`_ and its `example apt configurations <https://git.launchpad.net/curtin/tree/examples/apt-source.yaml>`_ for usage examples of these sections, such as how to add a PPA using the ``sources`` section.

The default apt configuration in Subiquity is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      apt:
        preserve_sources_list: false
        mirror-selection:
          primary:
            - country-mirror
            - uri: "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"
              arches: [i386, amd64]
            - uri: "http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports"
              arches: [s390x, arm64, armhf, powerpc, ppc64el, riscv64]
        fallback: abort
        geoip: true

mirror-selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ``primary`` section is contained within the ``mirror-selection`` section, the automatic mirror selection is enabled. This is the default in new installations.

primary (when placed inside the ``mirror-selection`` section)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* **type:** custom, see below

In the new format, the ``primary`` section expects a list of mirrors, which can be expressed in two different ways:

* The special ``country-mirror`` value
* A mapping with the following keys:

  * ``uri`` (Required): The URI of the mirror to use, e.g., ``http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu``.
  * ``arches`` (Optional): A list of architectures supported by the mirror. By default, this list contains the current CPU architecture.

The URI for the archive mirror does not have to be a country mirror, although it may be the most convenient, and can take the URL of any valid Ubuntu mirror. A list of all registered archive mirrors can be found on `Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors>`_.

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # Use the first custom mirror that works. Do not restrict to specific architectures.
  autoinstall:
    apt:
      mirror-selection:
        primary:
          - uri: "http://mirror1.internal/ubuntu"
          - uri: "http://mirror2.internal/ubuntu"

  # Use one mirror for amd64 and another for i386.
  autoinstall:
    apt:
      mirror-selection:
        primary:
          - uri: "http://jp.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"
            arches: [amd64]
          - uri: "http://tw.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"
            arches: [i386]

fallback
^^^^^^^^

* **type:** string (enumeration)
* **default:** ``offline-install``

Controls what Subiquity does when no primary mirror is usable. Supported values are:

* ``abort``: abort the installation
* ``offline-install``: revert to an offline installation
* ``continue-anyway``: attempt to install the system anyway (not recommended; the installation fails)

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Only install from the primary archive and abort the installation if mirror validation fails.
    autoinstall:
      apt:
        mirror-selection:
          primary:
            - uri: "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"
        fallback: abort

    # Only install from the German country mirror and continue with an offline install if mirror validation fails.
    autoinstall:
      apt:
        mirror-selection:
          primary:
            - uri: "http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"
        fallback: offline-install

geoip
^^^^^

* **type:** boolean
* **default:** ``true``

If ``geoip`` is set to ``true`` and one of the candidate primary mirrors has the special value ``country-mirror``, a request is made to ``https://geoip.ubuntu.com/lookup``. Subiquity then sets the mirror URI to ``http://CC.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu`` where ``CC`` is the country code returned by the lookup. If this section is not interactive, the request expires after 10 seconds.

If the legacy behavior (i.e., without mirror-selection) is in use, the geolocation request is made if the mirror to be used is the default, and its URI is replaced by the proper country mirror URI.

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Use the automatically determined country mirror first, followed by an explicit backup mirror.
    autoinstall:
      apt:
        mirror-selection:
          primary:
            - country-mirror
            - uri: http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
        geoip: true

    # Disable automatic country mirror detection (i.e. only use http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu)
    autoinstall:
      apt:
        geoip: false


.. _ai-storage:

storage
~~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** use the ``lvm`` layout on single-disk systems; there is no default for multiple-disk systems
* **can be interactive:** true

Storage configuration is a complex topic, and the description of the desired configuration in the autoinstall file can also be complex. The installer supports "layouts"; simple ways of expressing common configurations.

Supported layouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The three supported layouts at the time of writing are ``lvm``, ``direct`` and ``zfs``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        layout:
          name: lvm
      storage:
        layout:
          name: direct
      storage:
        layout:
          name: zfs


By default, these layouts install to the largest disk in a system, but you can supply a match spec (see below) to indicate which disk to use:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        layout:
          name: lvm
          match:
            serial: CT*
      storage:
        layout:
          name: direct
          match:
            ssd: true

.. note:: Match spec -- using ``match: {}`` matches an arbitrary disk.


By default (except on s390x), the matching disk will be partitioned using a GUID Partition Table (GPT). But you can specifically request a MSDOS (aka. MBR) partition table:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        layout:
          name: direct
          ptable: msdos

When using the ``lvm`` layout, LUKS encryption can be enabled by supplying a password.

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        layout:
          name: lvm
          password: LUKS_PASSPHRASE

The default is to use the ``lvm`` layout.

Additionally, TPM-backed encryption can be enabled by using the ``hybrid`` layout with ``encrypted`` set to yes.

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        layout:
          name: hybrid
          encrypted: yes

Sizing-policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``lvm`` layout, by default, attempts to leave room for snapshots and further expansion. A sizing-policy key may be supplied to control this behavior.

* **type:** string (enumeration)
* **default:** scaled

Supported values are:

* ``scaled``: Adjust space allocated to the root logical volume (LV) based on space available to the volume group (VG).
* ``all``: Allocate all remaining VG space to the root LV.

The scaling system uses the following rules:

* Less than 10 GiB: use all remaining space for the root file system
* Between 10--20 GiB: 10 GiB root file system
* Between 20--200 GiB: use half of the remaining space for the root file system
* Greater than 200 GiB: 100 GiB root file system

Example with no size scaling and a passphrase:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        layout:
          name: lvm
          sizing-policy: all
          password: LUKS_PASSPHRASE

Reset Partition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``reset-partition`` is used for creating a Reset Partition, which is a FAT32 file system containing the entire content of the installer image, so that the user can start the installer from GRUB or EFI without using the installation media. This option is useful for OEM system provisioning.

By default, the size of a Reset Partition is roughly 1.1x the used file system size of the installation media.

An example to enable Reset Partition:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        layout:
          name: direct
          reset-partition: true

The size of the reset partition can also be fixed to a specified size.  This is an example to fix Reset Partition to 12 GiB:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        layout:
          name: direct
          reset-partition: 12G

The installer can also install Reset Partition without installing the system.  To do this, set ``reset-partition-only`` to ``true``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        layout:
          name: direct
          reset-partition: true
          reset-partition-only: true

Action-based configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For full flexibility, the installer allows storage configuration to be done using a syntax that is a superset of that supported by curtin, as described in the `Storage <https://curtin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/storage.html>`_ section of the curtin documentation.

If the ``layout`` feature is used to configure the disks, the ``config`` section is not used.

The list of actions can be added under the ``config`` key, and the `grub <https://curtin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/config.html#grub>`_ and `swap <https://curtin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/config.html#swap>`_
curtin configuration items can also be included here.

An example storage section:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      storage:
        swap:
          size: 0
        config:
          - type: disk
            id: disk0
            serial: ADATA_SX8200PNP_XXXXXXXXXXX
          - type: partition
            ...

The extensions to the curtin syntax allow for disk selection and partition or logical-volume sizing.

.. _disk_selection_extensions:

Disk selection extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Curtin supported identifying disks by serial numbers (e.g. ``Crucial_CT512MX100SSD1_14250C57FECE``) or by path (e.g. ``/dev/sdc``), and the server installer supports this, too. The installer additionally supports a "match spec" on a disk action, which provides for more flexible matching.

The actions in the storage configuration are processed in the order they are in the autoinstall file. Any disk action is assigned a matching disk -- chosen arbitrarily from the set of unassigned disks if there is more than one, and causing the installation to fail if there is no unassigned matching disk.

A match spec supports the following keys:

* ``model: value``: matches a disk where ``ID_MODEL=value`` in udev, supporting globbing

* ``vendor: value``: matches a disk where ``ID_VENDOR=value`` in udev, supporting globbing

* ``path: value``: matches a disk based on path (e.g. ``/dev/sdc``), supporting globbing (the globbing support distinguishes this from specifying ``path: value`` directly in the disk action)

* ``id_path: value``: matches a disk where ``ID_PATH=value`` in udev, supporting globbing

* ``devpath: value``: matches a disk where ``DEVPATH=value`` in udev, supporting globbing

* ``serial: value``: matches a disk where ``ID_SERIAL=value`` in udev, supporting globbing (the globbing support distinguishes this from specifying ``serial: value`` directly in the disk action)

* ``ssd: true|false``: matches a disk that is or is not an SSD (as opposed to a rotating drive)

* ``size: largest|smallest``: take the largest or smallest disk rather than an arbitrary one if there are multiple matches (support for ``smallest`` added in version 20.06.1)

A special sort of key is ``install-media: true``, which takes the disk the installer was loaded from (the ``ssd`` and ``size`` selectors never return this disk). If installing to the installation media, be careful to not overwrite the installer itself.

For example, to match an arbitrary disk:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - type: disk
     id: disk0

To match the largest SSD:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - type: disk
     id: big-fast-disk
     match:
       ssd: true
       size: largest

To match a Seagate drive:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - type: disk
     id: data-disk
     match:
       model: Seagate

As of Subiquity 24.08.1, match specs may optionally be specified in an ordered
list, and will use the first match spec that matches one or more unused disks:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # attempt first to match by serial, then by path
   - type: disk
     id: data-disk
     match:
       - serial: Foodisk_1TB_ABC123_1
       - path: /dev/nvme0n1

Partition/logical volume extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The size of a partition or logical volume in curtin is specified as a number of bytes. The autoinstall configuration is more flexible:

* You can specify the size using the ``1G``, ``512M`` syntax supported in the installer UI.

* You can specify the size as a percentage of the containing disk (or RAID), e.g. ``50%``.

* For the last partition specified for a particular device, you can specify the size as ``-1`` to indicate that the partition should fill the remaining space.

.. code-block:: yaml

   - type: partition
     id: boot-partition
     device: root-disk
     size: 10%
   - type: partition
     id: root-partition
     size: 20G
   - type: partition
     id: data-partition
     device: root-disk
     size: -1

.. _ai-identity:

identity
~~~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** no default
* **can be interactive:** true

Configure the initial user for the system. This is the only configuration key that must be present (unless the :ref:`user-data section <ai-user-data>` is present, in which case it is optional).

A mapping that can contain keys, all of which take string values:

realname
^^^^^^^^

The real name for the user. This field is optional.

username
^^^^^^^^

The user name to create.

hostname
^^^^^^^^

The hostname for the system.

password
^^^^^^^^

The password for the new user, encrypted. This is required for use with ``sudo``, even if SSH access is configured.

The encrypted password string must conform to what the ``passwd`` command requires. See the :manpage:`passwd(1)` manual page for details. Quote the password hash to ensure correct treatment of any special characters.

Several tools can generate the encrypted password, such as ``mkpasswd`` from the ``whois`` package, or ``openssl passwd``.

Example:

.. _ai-identity-example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      identity:
        realname: 'Ubuntu User'
        username: ubuntu
        password: '$6$wdAcoXrU039hKYPd$508Qvbe7ObUnxoj15DRCkzC3qO7edjH0VV7BPNRDYK4QR8ofJaEEF2heacn0QgD.f8pO8SNp83XNdWG6tocBM1'
        hostname: ubuntu

.. _ai-active-directory:

active-directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** no default

Accepts data required to join the target system in an Active Directory domain.

A mapping that can contain keys, all of which take string values:

admin-name
^^^^^^^^^^

A domain account name with the privilege to perform the join operation. The account password is requested during run time.

domain-name
^^^^^^^^^^^

The Active Directory domain to join.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     active-directory:
       # Join the Active Directory domain as user "$ubuntu"
       admin-name: $ubuntu

       # Enable Ubuntu-Pro using a contract token
       # Note that the example below is an invalid contract token.
       token: C1NWcZTHLteJXGVMM6YhvHDpGrhyy7

.. _ai-ssh:

ssh
~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** see below
* **can be interactive:** true

Configure SSH for the installed system. A mapping that can contain the following keys:

install-server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **type:** boolean
* **default:** ``false``

Whether to install the OpenSSH server in the target system. Note that Desktop installation ISOs do not include ``openssh-server``, so installations of Desktop require Ubuntu archive access for ``install-server`` to be successful.

authorized-keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **type:** list of strings
* **default:** ``[]``

A list of SSH public keys to install in the initial user account.

allow-pw
^^^^^^^^

* **type:** boolean
* **default:** ``true`` if ``authorized_keys`` is empty, ``false`` otherwise

``ssh`` examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # default behavior
     ssh:
       install-server: false
       authorized-keys: []
       allow-pw: true

   autoinstall:
     # recommended configuration when openssh-server is desired
     ssh:
       install-server: true
       authorized-keys:
         # replace with the contents of the public key(s) as generated by
         # ssh-keygen or similar tools
         - ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC..6O8tvZobj user@host
       allow-pw: false

   autoinstall:
     # configuration for password access
     ssh:
       install-server: true
       allow-pw: true

.. _ai-codecs:

codecs
~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** see below
* **can be interactive:** no

Configure whether common restricted packages (including codecs) from the multiverse repository are to be installed.

install
^^^^^^^

* **type:** boolean
* **default:** ``false``

Whether to install the ``ubuntu-restricted-addons`` package.

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # default behavior
     codecs:
       install: false

   autoinstall:
     # install codecs, which currently means installing the
     # ubuntu-restricted-addons package
     codecs:
       install: true

.. _ai-drivers:

drivers
~~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** see below
* **can be interactive:** true

install
^^^^^^^

* **type:** boolean
* **default:** ``false``

Whether to install the available third-party drivers.

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # default behavior
     drivers:
       install: false

   autoinstall:
     # install drivers as suggested by `ubuntu-drivers`.
     drivers:
       install: true

.. _ai-oem:

oem
~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** see below
* **can be interactive:** no

install
^^^^^^^

* **type:** boolean or string (special value ``auto``)
* **default:**: ``auto``

Whether to install the available OEM meta-packages. The special value ``auto`` -- which is the default -- enables the installation on Ubuntu Desktop but not on Ubuntu Server. This option has no effect on core boot classic.

As installing an OEM meta-package can result in installing a certain kernel, specifying both a kernel with :ref:`ai-kernel` and also specifying ``oem.install: true`` may lead to an install failure due to conflicting kernel requirements.  When using oem.install, it is recommended to not specify a kernel.

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # default behavior
     oem:
       install: auto

   autoinstall:
     # Install OEM meta-packages as suggested by ubuntu-drivers.
     # On some hardware, this changes what kernel is installed.
     oem:
       install: true

   autoinstall:
     # Disable OEM meta-package automatic installation, even if suggested to do
     # so by ubuntu-drivers
     oem:
       install: false

.. _ai-snaps:

snaps
~~~~~

* **type:** list
* **default:** install no extra snaps
* **can be interactive:** true

A list of snaps to install. Each snap is represented as a mapping with a required ``name`` and an optional ``channel`` (default is ``stable``) and classic (default is ``false``) keys. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    autoinstall:
      snaps:
        - name: etcd
          channel: edge
          classic: false

.. _ai-debconf-selections:

debconf-selections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** string
* **default:** no configuration
* **can be interactive:** no

The installer updates the target with debconf ``set-selection`` values. Users need to be familiar with the options of the ``debconf`` package.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # 1. Make sure history files are purged if one runs `apt purge etckeeper`
     # 2. Disable SSH password authentication for root (which is actually the
     # default behavior)
     # Watch out, permit-root-login does basically the opposite of
     # PermitRootLogin (see man 8 sshd_config):
     #  * openssh-server/permit-root-login boolean false  <=>  PermitRootLogin yes
     #  * openssh-server/permit-root-login boolean true   <=>  # PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
     # See https://salsa.debian.org/ssh-team/openssh/-/blob/78b01f70b043846640887cc295f66ecd66ac0714/debian/openssh-server.postinst#L70-73
     # and LP: #2128863
     # 3. Start the ufw firewall automatically.

     debconf-selections: |
       etckeeper etckeeper/purge boolean true
       openssh-server openssh-server/permit-root-login boolean true
       ufw ufw/enable boolean true

.. _ai-packages:

packages
~~~~~~~~

* **type:** list
* **default:** no packages
* **can be interactive:** no

A list of packages to install into the target system. Specifically, a list of strings to pass to the :command:`apt-get install` command. Therefore, this includes things such as task selection (``dns-server^``) and installing particular versions of a package (``my-package=1-1``).

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  autoinstall:
    packages:
      # Install ipython3 and git, and ensure they are marked as manually
      # installed.
      - ipython3
      - git

.. _ai-kernel:

kernel
~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping (mutually exclusive), see below
* **default:** default kernel
* **can be interactive:** no

Which kernel gets installed. Either the name of the package or the name of the flavor must be specified.

The exact default kernel is ISO build specific, but generally the ``generic`` flavor is installed for Server and the ``hwe`` flavor is installed for Desktop.

package
^^^^^^^

**type:** string

The name of the package, e.g., ``linux-image-5.13.0-40-generic``.

flavor
^^^^^^

* **type:** string

The ``flavor`` of the kernel, e.g., ``generic`` or ``hwe``.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
      # Install a specific kernel package.
      kernel:
        package: linux-image-5.13.0-40-generic

   autoinstall:
      # Install a particular kernel flavor.
      kernel:
        flavor: hwe

.. _ai-kernel-crash-dumps:

kernel-crash-dumps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping, see below
* **default:** see below
* **can be interactive:** no

Toggle kernel crash dumps enablement.

In 24.10 and later, the default configuration will result in dynamic enablement of kernel crash dumps on the installed system using the ``kdump-tools`` package. On amd64, arm64, and s390x systems, if the system is detected to meet the minimum requirements for kernel crash dumps then they will be enabled. Otherwise, they will be disabled. More details about the minimum system requirements can be found in the :external+ubuntu-server:ref:`Ubuntu Server documentation<kernel-crash-dump>`.

In pre-24.10, the default configuration will result in kernel crash dumps being disabled.

Default configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
      # In 24.10 and later, allow kernel crash dumps to be enabled dynamically.
      # In pre-24.10, kernel crash dumps will be disabled.
      kernel-crash-dumps:
        enabled: null

enabled
^^^^^^^

* **type:** boolean or null
* **default:** ``null``

Specify a boolean value to enable or disable kernel crash dumps. Set to ``null`` (default) to allow dynamic enablement.

If kernel crash dumps are to be disabled, whether determined dynamically or manually requested, the ``kdump-tools`` package will not be uninstalled but will be configured to ensure it is inactive in the target system.

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
      # Enable kernel crash dumps.
      kernel-crash-dumps:
        enabled: true

   autoinstall:
      # Disable kernel crash dumps.
      kernel-crash-dumps:
        enabled: false

.. _ai-timezone:

timezone
~~~~~~~~

* **type:** string
* **default:** no timezone
* **can be interactive:** no

The timezone to configure on the system.

timezone examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
      # Default behavior
      timezone: "Etc/UTC"

   autoinstall:
      # Configure explicitly
      timezone: "Europe/London"

.. _ai-updates:

updates
~~~~~~~

* **type:** string (enumeration)
* **default:** ``security``
* **can be interactive:** no

The type of updates that will be downloaded and installed after the system installation, and before rebooting into the target system. Supported values are:

* ``security``: download and install updates from the ``-security`` pocket.
* ``all``: also download and install updates from the ``-updates`` pocket.

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # default behavior.  Updates from the security pocket are installed.
     updates: security

   autoinstall:
     # Updates from both the security and updates pockets are installed.
     updates: all

.. _ai-shutdown:

shutdown
~~~~~~~~

* **type:** string (enumeration)
* **default:** ``reboot``
* **can be interactive:** no

Request the system to power off or reboot automatically after the installation has finished. Supported values are:

* ``reboot``
* ``poweroff``

shutdown examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # default behavior
     shutdown: reboot

   autoinstall:
     # shutdown instead of reboot
     shutdown: poweroff

.. _ai-late-commands:

late-commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** :ref:`command list<ai-command-lists>`
* **default:** no commands
* **can be interactive:** no

Shell commands to run after the installation has completed successfully and any updates and packages installed, just before the system reboots. The commands are run in the installer environment with the installed system mounted at ``/target``. You can run ``curtin in-target -- $shell_command`` (with the version of Subiquity
released with 20.04 GA, you need to specify this as ``curtin in-target --target=/target -- $shell_command``) to run in the target system (similar to how plain ``in-target`` can be used in ``d-i preseed/late_command``).


Example late commands:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # Pause the install just before finishing to allow manual inspection/modification.
     # Unpause by creating the "/run/finish-late" file.
     late-commands:
       - while [ ! -f /run/finish-late ]; do sleep 1; done

   autoinstall:
     # Install additional packages on the target system and run some custom scripts.
     late-commands:
       - curtin in-target -- apt-get update
       - curtin in-target -- apt-get install -y curl vim
       - curtin in-target -- curl -o /tmp/my-script.sh $script_url
       - curtin in-target -- /bin/sh /tmp/my-script.sh

.. _ai-error-commands:

error-commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** :ref:`command list<ai-command-lists>`
* **default:** no commands
* **can be interactive:** no

Shell commands to run after the installation has failed. They are run in the installer environment, and the target system (or as much of it as the installer managed to configure) is mounted at ``/target``. Logs will be available in :file:`/var/log/installer` in the live session.

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     # Collect all of the logs in /var/log/installer
     # Collect the live system journal too
     error-commands:
       - tar -czf /installer-logs.tar.gz /var/log/installer/
       - journalctl -b > /installer-journal.log

.. _ai-reporting:

reporting
~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping
* **default:** ``type: print`` (which causes output on ``tty1`` and any configured serial consoles)
* **can be interactive:** no

The installer supports reporting progress to a variety of destinations. Note that this section is ignored if there are any :ref:`interactive sections <ai-interactive-sections>`; it only applies to fully automated installations.

The configuration is similar to that used by curtin. See the `Reporting <https://curtin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/reporting.html>`_ section of the curtin documentation.

Each key in the ``reporting`` mapping in the configuration defines a destination where the ``type`` sub-key is one of:

* ``print``: print progress information on ``tty1`` and any configured serial console. There is no other configuration.
* ``rsyslog``: report progress via rsyslog. The ``destination`` key specifies where to send output. (The rsyslog reporter does not yet exist.)
* ``webhook``: report progress by sending JSON reports to a URL using POST requests. Accepts the same `configuration as curtin <https://curtin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/reporting.html#webhook-reporter>`_.
* ``none``: do not report progress. Only useful to inhibit the default output.

Reporting examples:

The default configuration is:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     reporting:
       builtin:
         type: print

Report to rsyslog:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     reporting:
       central:
         type: rsyslog
         destination: "@192.168.0.1"


Suppress the default output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     reporting:
       builtin:
         type: none

Report to a curtin-style webhook:

.. code-block:: yaml

   autoinstall:
     reporting:
       hook:
         type: webhook
         endpoint: http://example.com/endpoint/path
         consumer_key: "ck_value"
         consumer_secret: "cs_value"
         token_key: "tk_value"
         token_secret: "tk_secret"
         level: INFO

.. _ai-user-data:

user-data
~~~~~~~~~

* **type:** mapping
* **default:** ``{}``
* **can be interactive:** no

Provide cloud-init user data, which will be merged with the user data the installer produces. If you supply this, you don't need to supply an :ref:`identity section <ai-identity>` (in that case, ensure you can log in to the installed system). For more details on cloud-init user-data, see :doc:`cloud-init:reference/examples`.

The following example provides user-data which is approximately equivalent to what is generated by the configuration in the :ref:`identity section example<ai-identity-example>`:

.. code-block:: yaml

  autoinstall:
    user-data:
       users:
         - name: ubuntu
           gecos: 'Ubuntu User'
           passwd: '$6$wdAcoXrU039hKYPd$508Qvbe7ObUnxoj15DRCkzC3qO7edjH0VV7BPNRDYK4QR8ofJaEEF2heacn0QgD.f8pO8SNp83XNdWG6tocBM1'
           groups: adm, cdrom, dip, lxd, plugdev, sudo
           shell: /bin/bash
           lock_passwd: False

.. _ai-zdevs:

zdevs
~~~~~

* **type:** list of devices
* **default:** ``[]``
* **can be interactive:** yes

On IBM Z, configure the state (enabled or disabled) of supported devices.

Each element (i.e., device) of the list is a mapping with the following keys:

id
^^

**type:** string

Identifies the device to operate on.

enabled
^^^^^^^

**type:** boolean

Controls whether the device should be enabled or disabled.

.. code-block:: yaml

  autoinstall:
    zdevs:
      - id: 0.0.1507
        enabled: true
      - id: 0.0.1508
        enabled: true
